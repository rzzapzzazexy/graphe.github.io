<h2><center>Tips for Landscape Photography</center>
<ol>
  <li>The magic hour</li>
  <p>Beautiful landscape photos are often defined by the quality of light they were taken in. As a consequence, photographers tend to shoot early in the morning or during late afternoons when the sun is lower, less contrasty and often displays a subtle colour palette of moody hues. For this reason, the hours after dawn and before dusk are known as the 'magic hours'. If rising at dawn doesn't sit well with your idea of a relaxing weekend, don't panic - there are plenty of great landscape opportunities throughout the day.</p>
  <img src="">
  <li>Composition</li>
  <p>Composition is key to successful landscape photography, and if you don't know where to start, use the 'rule of thirds' to get things going. Perhaps the king of all beginner landscape photography tips, it's an easy principle to apply - simply divide your frame into imaginary thirds on both the horizontal and vertical axis. Now simply place areas of interest at the points at which the lines intersect or - in the case of a horizon - along one of the lines. However, don't be afraid to throw away the rule book and totally disregard the conventions of composition. While you might have some awful failures, you might also create an original and striking masterpiece. Be bold and experiment.</p>
  <img src="">
  <li>Get out there</li>
  <p>There's no substitute for putting in a bit of groundwork before embarking on a photographic adventure. Research and find the best photo locations, get a map, a compass and remember that you'll probably have to get out of the car and walk to get the best shots.</p>
  <li>Polarising filters</li>
  <p>Most landscape photographers will have a circular polarising filter in their kit bag. There are many uses for filters like this, but for the landscape photographer the two key characteristics are their ability to cut out reflections and nasty glare from a scene and the increased colour intensity, saturation and contrast they create. You'll really notice the effect in clear blue skies.</p>
  <img src="">
  <li>Depth of field</li>
  <p>Many landscape photographers desire an image that appears sharp throughout the scene, so that elements of foreground interest, such as a rock in a lake, look just as sharp as the distant horizon. This can be achieved relatively easily using the principles of depth of field, whereby the smaller an aperture you use, such as f/22, the greater the area both before and beyond the point of focus also appear to be sharp. This principle can be taken one step further with hyperfocal distance focusing. Generally, when you're using small apertures you'll need to compensate with slow shutter speeds, so it is essential to (know how to) use a tripod.</p>
  <img src="">
  <li>ND grads</li>
  <p>One of the great problems for landscape photographers is the difference in brightness between the sky and the land. While the human eye is capable of perceiving detail across this tonal range, a digital sensor isn't capable of recording it. So ND Grad filters (neutral density graduated filters) were created and have been avidly used by landscape shooters ever since. Their gradual transition from clear to dark neutral density allows the photographer to balance the exposure between the sky and the land to make a more even exposure in which detail remains in both the highlight and shadow areas. An alternative to this is exposure blending, where different exposures are made of the scene and combined in software later.</p>
  <img src="">
  <li>Man and the landscape</li>
  <p>Great landscape photography is not necessarily about hunting out the most picturesque scene, in the most wonderful light and at the most perfect time of day. Indeed, there are many aspects of the world's landscape that are less glamorous, such as the effects of heavy farming, rapidly expanding suburbs and sprawling industrial wastelands, that can make a poignant subject for the concerned photographer. Take a look at the effects of man on the landscape near your home and use them as photographic subjects.</p>
  <img src="">
  <li>RAW</li>
  <p>To maximise on quality and also to allow you to edit your original images non-destructively, always shoot raw files when taking landscapes. RAW processing software, such as Adobe Camera Raw, is now so sophisticated that unless you want to significantly manipulate your image you rarely need to switch to traditional image-editing software, such as Photoshop.</p>
  <img src="">
  <li>Slow exposures</li>
  <p>Slow exposures are regularly used by landscape photographers, whether it's to optimise depth of field with a small aperture or to create smooth and milky seascapes by taking long exposure pictures of the sea. Exposures can be seconds (rather than fractions of a second) long, so a sturdy tripod is a must. To further minimise camera movement during the exposure consider using a cable release or your camera's self-timer, as well as locking the mirror up.</p>
  <li>Inspirational photographers</li>
  <p>There are many great landscape photographers to draw inspiration from, as a simple Google search will prove. However, it's worth looking at the work of Ansel Adams, who is often considered the old master of landscape photography and one of the best photographers of all time. If you get the chance to see his work in a gallery, make sure you go! Closer to home, the work of Fay Godwin reveals aspects of man's influence on the land in a unique way. And, of course, the work of favourites such as Joe Cornish, Charlie Waite and David Noton is sure to inspire…</p>

<h2><center>Tips for Portrait Photography</center>
<ol>
<ol>
  <li>Frame Your Subject</li>
  <p>Framing is a technique where by you draw attention to one element of an image by framing it with another element of the image.</p>
  <img src="">
  <li>Go with a Wide Angle</li>
  <p>Shooting with a wide angle lens attached to your camera can help create some memorable shots when you’re doing portrait photography. At very wide focal lengths you can create some wonderful distortion. It might not be the type of shot you take of your wife or girlfriend (unless she’s in a playful mood) but using these focal lengths will enlarge parts of the face or body that are on the edge of the frame more than what is in the centre.</p>
  <img src="">
  <li>Play With Backgrounds</li>
  <p>The person in your portrait is the main point of interest – however sometimes when you place them into different contexts with different backgrounds you can dramatically alter the mood in a shot. Sometimes you want your background to be as minimalistic as possible.</p>
  <img src="">
  <li>Change the Format Framing</li>
  <p>Many photographers get stuck in a rut of only ever shooting either in ‘landscape’ (when the camera is held horizontally) or ‘portrait’ (when the camera is held vertically) modes. Look back through your images and see which one you use predominantly. Just because a vertical framing is called ‘portrait’ mode doesn’t mean you always need to use it when shooting portraits. Mix your framing up in each shoot that you do and you’ll add variety to the type of shots you take.</p>
  <img src="">
  <li>Hold Your Camera on an Angle</li>
  <p>Horizontal and Vertical framings are not the only options when it comes to shooting portraits. While getting your images straight can be important in when shooting in these formats holding your camera on a more diagonal angle can also inject a little fun into your images. This type of framing can add a sense of fun and energy into your shots. Just don’t ‘slightly’ do it or you’ll have people asking themselves if you might have mistakenly held your camera crooked.</p>
  <img src="">
  <li>Take Unfocused Shots</li>
  <p>As photographers we have ‘sharp focus’ drummed into us as an ultimate objective to achieve in our work – but sometimes lack of focus can create shots with real emotion, mood and interest.</p>
  <img src="">
  <li>Introduce Movement</li>
  <p>Portraits can be so static – but what if you added some movement into them? This can be achieved in a few ways:</p>
  <img src="">
  <li>Experiment with Subject Expressions</li>
  <p>In some portraits it is the expression on the face of your subject that makes the image. Get your subject to experiment with different moods and emotions in your image. Play with extreme emotions</p>
  <img src="">
  <li>Fill the Frame</li>
  <p>One way to ensure that your subject captures the attention of the viewer of your portrait is to fill the frame with their face.It’s not something that you’d do in every shot that you take – but if your subject is the only feature in the shot – there’s really nowhere else to look.</p>
  <img src="">
  <li>Find an Interesting Subject</li>
  <p>I have a friend who regularly goes out on the streets around Melbourne looking for interesting people to photograph. When he finds someone that he finds interesting he approaches them, asks if they’d pose for him, he quickly finds a suitable background and then shoots off a handful of shots quickly (if they give him permission of course). The result is that he has the most wonderful collection of photographs of people of all ages, ethnicities and backgrounds. While many of us spend most of our time photographing our loved ones – perhaps it’d be an interesting exercise to shoot interesting strangers once in a while?</p>
